Topic: "Discussion: problems that arise in applying constitutional law to
modern technology in order to protect the privacy rights of individuals," 

Required material:
 - ["Katz v. United States: Supreme Court Case, Arguments, Impact."][gg_katz]
   This describes the facts of the Katz v. United States Supreme Court case in
which a wiretap was used to record a private conversation in a public
phonebooth.  It presents the main standard for which the Fourth Amendment is
applied to various communications, called the Katz test, which requires both an
objective and subjective expectation of privacy.
 - ["The Fourth Amendment and Computers: Is a Computer Just Another Container
   or Are New Rules Required to Reflect New Technologies?"][gg_fourth] This
article is a summary of the most important issues related to applying the
Fourth Amendment and related case law to computers. It provides a set of topics
and relevant legal considerations on those topics to form a foundation for
discussing the Fourth Amendment in the context of electronic devices and
communication.
 - [SMITH v. MARYLAND.][gg_smith_maryland] This is a court opinion for a case
   in which the police had a telephone company install a pen register on
suspect’s phone, and were able to record the numbers he dialed. This search was
objected to by the defendant on Fourth Amendment grounds, and it is one of the
first cases to apply the doctrines of the Fourth Amendment to modern technology
such as phone communication.
 - [In Re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum, 670 F.3d 1335 (11th Cir.
   2012).][gg_in_re] This is a court opinion on a case where a suspect was
being compelled to decrypt the contents of his hard drive, but refused to do so
by invoking his Fifth Amendment right not to self-incriminate. It addresses the
question of whether or not decryption is a testimonial act that can be
compelled by the government, and what is being testified when a person performs
decryption such as entering a password on their personal computer.

### Discussion Questions

How can the scope of a search be well-defined for electronic searches?
 - Given how easy it is to hide information on a computer, for example, how can the scope of the search be limited without impeding the ability to find actual evidence? 
   + Does this give the searcher the ability to open any file on the computer?
 - Is the computer akin to a container (like a drawer in a house that might contain contraband) whose contents need to be searched with particularity? How can bounds be set on this container like a physical one?
 - What about all of the factors that differentiate electronics from physical containers?
   + The persistence of the evidence stored on them
   + The volume of information kept on them
   + The prevalence of many types of electronic items (everyone has a smart phone)
   + How easy it is to make an exact copy (is that a seizure?)

How should the plain view doctrine apply to electronic devices?
 - What if a third party is responsible for searching the device?

How can we apply the Katz test to electronic communications?
 - Does encrypting a message demonstrate a reasonable expectation of privacy under the Katz test?
   + Does it satisfy both the subjective and objective expectations of privacy?
   + How does it compare to speaking in another language and expecting no one
will be able to translate what you've said?
   + What about very easy to break encryption?
   + How does it compare to the situation of a sealed envelope or a postcard?
 - How much does the average consumer’s technological knowledge contribute to the answer to this question?
 - How does the third party doctrine apply to more modern technologies and forms of communication, like text messages or email?

In the “In re…” opinion, was the foregone conclusion doctrine correctly applied?
 - When entering the password, what testimony is being given?
   + Is it only, "I know the password"?
   + Is it, "I own this device"?
   + Is it testimony about any of the contents beyond the password?
 - Is there a distinction to be made between entering the password vs. telling the password to the authorities?

Would the conclusion be different if the method to unlock the computer were not a password, but a biometric one, like fingerprint or facial recognition software?
