Topic: "Discussion: IoT Devices Major Security Issues and Privacy Concerns"
led by Brian McKay.

Required material:
  - ["What is IoT?"][bm_iot]. For anyone who might not completely understand 
	or needs to refresh their knowledge on what IoT is and the application for 
	these devices, this is a necessary read. It also dives into the security 
	and privacy related issues for these devices, and the vulnerabilities of 
	these devices based on the device's real-world applications.
  - ["Top 10 Biggest IoT Security Issues"][bm_sec]. Offers a broad description 
	of the top 10 security-related issues with IoT devices. It paints a big 
	picture for both security and privacy concerns in IoT devices and is 
	necessary to understand why these devices are so vulnerable.
  - ["How teen scammers and CCTV cameras almost brought down the internet"][bm_hack]. On October 12, 2016, a massive distributed denial of service 
	attack left much of the internet inaccessible on the U.S. east coast. The 
	attack, which authorities initially feared was the work of a hostile 
	nation-state, was in fact the work of the Mirai botnet which took advantage 
	of thousands of IoT devices to form the ultimate weapon.
   - ["Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020"][bm_bill]. 
    Days before taking a week-long Thanksgiving recess, the US Senate passed 
    an almost mundane cybersecurity bill that, if approved by the President, 
    will improve security guidelines and protocols for Internet of Things 
    devices purchased and owned by the Federal government.
  - ["Banned In Germany: Kids' Doll Is Labeled An Espionage Device"][bm_doll].
	A doll called My Friend Cayla listens a little too well; the toy is 
	essentially a stealthy espionage device that shares what it hears and is 
	also vulnerable to takeover by third parties. There is a video within 
	the article that is a necessary watch.
  - ["Romanian hackers took over D.C. surveillance cameras just before presidential inauguration"][bm_cam]. Romanian hackers took over two-thirds 
	of the District's outdoor surveillance cameras just before President 
	Trump's inauguration. Example of the possible political weapons or 
	censorship these devices might be capable of if exploited.
  - ["FDA confirms that St. Jude's cardiac devices can be hacked"][bm_fda].
	The FDA confirmed that St. Jude Medical's implantable cardiac devices have 
	vulnerabilities that could allow a hacker to access a device. Once in, 
	they could deplete the battery or administer incorrect pacing or shocks.
	This is a strong example of how implementing poorly secure IoT devices in 
	healthcare could have dire consequences. 
Optional material:
  - ["Defenseless internet 'paying the price' for ignoring security"][bm_hack2].
	A different perspective and summary of the Mirai botnet attack. Short summary 
	of the attack, and the perspective as to why it happened and why it can easily 
	happen again.
  - ["Amazon has a fix for Alexa's creepy laughs"][bm_alexa]. This article describes 
	the random creepy laughter of amazon Alexa capable devices. This was not so much 
	a cause from a security flaw, but poor user-feedback design, which was fixed. It 
	portrays the creepiness of devices that we rely on so much for information and convenience. 
  - ["'Child's Play' trailer shows Chucky controlling smart homes and drones"][bm_child]. 
	Short article with a trailer of the new Child's Play movie, that portrays the modern horror 
	doll as an internet-connected device that is capable of controlling other such devices. 
	Just imagine a hacker doing the same; it is possible, and scary to think about, especially 
	given the security posture of most of these devices.
