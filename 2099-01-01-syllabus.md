### Instructor's Description

This course explores both low- and high-level topics in software and systems
security. The course will proceed along two distinct tracks: The *technical
track* provides students with experience executing actual software attacks. The
*discussion track* explores high-level concepts and the broader implications of
security. Many of these topics are advanced, and I have designed this course to
be challenging yet rewarding.

The centerpiece of the technical track is a capture-the-flag-style challenge
system. Lectures will introduce a new topic related to software security, and
then challenge binaries will be released. These binaries will test your
knowledge and skill in detecting vulnerabilities in software and then
exploiting these vulnerabilities. Students who have participated in
capture-the-flag competitions will be familiar with this structure.

The discussion track will focus on broader topics, including the economics of
security, computer crime, usability, and social issues. I expect each student
to participate in the discussions. 
        

### Recommended Background

Binary exploitation, by nature, is difficult for many students. To exploit
software bugs, a student needs to have a solid understanding of how code is
executed. My goal is to equip each student with the tools and techniques needed
to understand, exploit, and protect actual binaries. However, I do expect a
certain level of baseline knowledge. Below, I list a few topics that students
should be comfortable with before taking this class.

The content of this course builds upon the foundation laid down in
undergraduate CS courses such as  *CS2303: Systems Programming Concepts*,
*CS2011: Machine Organization and Assembly Language*, and *CS3013: Operating
Systems.* It is expected that you already have a working knowledge of the
following tools and topics:

 - The basics of systems programming, including the C programming language,
   pointers, variable representations, and endianness.
 - The memory layout of C Programs, including the mechanics and purpose of the
   stack, heap, and code sections. 
 - The x86/x64 instruction set architecture, including an ability to read and
   understand assembly language.
 - Basics of operating systems, including system calls, virtual memory,
  threading, and permissions
 - Familiarity with tools such as Bash and GDB.

It is highly recommended to review these topics, **especially C programming and
assembly** in the first week of class, as they are **critical** to completion
of the technical coursework.


## Course Policies and Procedures

The following represent the official policies and procedures for the course.
Please review this information and, if you have questions, discuss them with
me as soon as possible.

### Ethical Hacking Agreement

All students  must sign the [ethical hacking
agreement](https://cerebro.cs.wpi.edu/ethical_hacking/index.php) to acknowledge
that you will use the skills and knowledge you acquire in this course in an
ethical and legal manner.


### Official Communication

Class discussion, emails to the studentâ€™s WPI email account, the course
Discord, and the course web pages are avenues for official course communication.
Students are responsible for any information posted through these venues.

### Textbooks

We will not be using an assigned textbook in this course. Students will be
responsible for obtaining the reading from the links provided by the
instructor.

### Grading and Binary Challenges

Grades will be determined by the number of challenge points each student earns.
Challenges will be accessible via the course infrastructure. They will often
involve exploiting a bug in a binary to obtain a *flag*. Students can enter this
flag into the course webpage to earn points for that challenge.

Challenges may cover various *categories*, including lecture practice, binary
exploitation, course participation, game exploitation, and others. The number
of points a challenge is worth serves as a rough estimate of the challenge's
relative difficulty.  Challenge flags are unique to each student. Further, the
exact steps needed to solve each challenge may depend on the student's
particular challenge instance.  Finally, it is a bad idea to hoard flags as
they may expire after a few days!

**Student independence.** Developing the skills to solve each of the challenges
requires completing assigned readings and videos, practicing with the
introduced tools, and independent exploration by the student. For example, a
challenge may require the student to read compiler documentation to understand
how factors, such as buffer size, might influence compilation. Further, the
student may need to seek out such documentation independently.

**Challenge time limits.** New challenges will be released throughout the
course as we cover more material. Students must solve a challenge prior to the
posted deadline to receive points. Some challenges (but not all) will remain
available for the entire duration of the course, e.g., participation
challenges. I will announce the deadline for each challenge as it is released. 

**Participation challenges.** There are various participation challenges that a
student can earn simply by helping improve the quality of the course. Before
working on any of the participation challenges, **students should contact me to
ensure that the work's scope is sufficient to earn points.** 

**Student challenge submissions.** Students are encouraged, but not required,
to submit new challenge binaries.  When submitting a new binary, please include
the source code, solution (e.g., as a python script), recommended point value,
recommended title, a makefile, description of the challenge, list of hints, and
a list of related challenges.  **Please contact me before starting
work on a new challenge. Also, I will typically not accept any new challenge
submissions prior to the ninth lecture.**

**Mandatory challenges.** There are some challenges  that students must solve
to pass the course. These challenges are listed under the mandatory category.
One notable example is `the-bar`. To solve this challenge, the student must
understand all of the basic binary attacks introduced in the course. 

**Challenge difficulty.** The challenges are roughly divide into the following
difficulty levels: We expect to release roughly 45 challenges with an 
available point total greater than 6500.  

 - **Introductory:** Challenges with a score value between 0 and 75 points
   inclusive. We expect to release 15--20 challenges of this level. 
 - **Basic:** Challenges with a score value between 76 and 150 points
   inclusive. We expect to release 5--8 challenges of this level.
 - **Intermediate:** Challenges with a score value between 151 and 300 points
   inclusive. We expect to release 8--12 challenges of this level.
 - **Advanced:** Challenges with a score value between 301 and 600 points
   inclusive. We expect to release 3--5 challenges of this level.
 - **Expert:** Challenges with a score value greater than 600 points. We do not
   currently have any challenges of this level, but hopefully one day...

**Letter grades.** The final letter grade will depend on the number of
challenge points earned by a student. I may adjust the particular point cutoff
for each grade based on the overall performance of the class; however, the
final cutoffs will be similar to the following:

 - **C:** 2000 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory
   challenges. This point value is roughly what you'd get by solving all
lecture challenges, the-bar, and two additional basic challenges. 
 - **B:** 3000 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory
   challenges. This value is roughly what you'd get by  solving all lecture
challenges, the-bar, two additional basic challenges, and five additional
intermediate challenges.
 - **A:** 4500 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory
   challenges. This value is roughly what you'd get by solving all lecture
challenges, the-bar, two additional basic challenges, seven additional
intermediate challenges, and two additional advanced challenges.



**Course Webpage.**All students must submit the challenge flags through the
course webpage. The course webpage includes a scoreboard that displays the
progress of your peers. **When creating an account, you are welcome to use a
pseudonym. That is, you do not need to use your WPI username. However, if you
decide to use a pseudonym, then you must inform the teaching staff (via email)
of the username that you have selected.** **Students must also join the
`CS557` classroom (owner is `ctfadmin`) on the course webpage.** If a student does not adhere to
these two requirements, the instructor will not be able to track the student's
progress and, thus, they will not receive a grade.

### Attacking the Course Infrastructure

Attacking the Course Infrastructure is strictly prohibited. Any attacks will be
met with appropriate disciplinary actions, including but not limited to,
failing the course and notifying the university and local law enforcement. If
you notice a flaw or potential exploit, please notify me directly and do not
attempt to exploit (or fix) it.

###  Professionalism

Students must treat each other and the teaching staff with respect at all
times. Disagreement, debates, and criticism of ideas are healthy aspects of
academic environments; however, students should be careful to avoid demeaning
language or personal attacks. The ability to handle conflict professionally and
work with a variety of people is an acquired skill, yet it is increasingly
important in technical careers.


### Academic Honesty 

Students should read and be familiar with [WPI's Academic Honesty
Policy](https://www.wpi.edu/about/policies/academic-integrity/dishonesty).  Any
suspected instance of academic dishonesty will be dealt with according to WPI
policies, which dictate that I report such instances to the Dean of Students.

**Do not provide your solutions to others, either directly or via some sort of
public posting. This includes public code repositories such as those found on
Github. This prohibition extends for the duration of the course. In other
words, even if the project deadline has passed, you may not post your solution
publicly at any point during the term. Doing so is a violation of the WPI's
prohibition against facilitating academic dishonesty.**

Likewise, students may not reference any previous versions of a course
assignment or project, regardless of how it is posted. If a student discovers
such a posting, they should report it to the instructor immediately, avoid the
resource in the future, and delete any copies that are cached on their
computer.

Cheating is usually the result of other problems in school. Please come see the
course staff if you are unable to keep up with the work for any reason and we
will work something out. We want to see you succeed and will do everything we
can to help you out!

Your solution must always be your own work.  You may discuss course material
with others, but only during the lectures or via the public channels on the
course Discord server. Further, you may only share limited snippets of code in
the context of debugging.   When in doubt, contact me about whether a potential
action would be considered plagiarism. Also note that the facilitation of
plagiarism (giving your work to someone else) is academic dishonesty as well.

Plagiarism and other anti-intellectual behavior will be dealt with severely. If
you engage in academic dishonesty, you will almost certainly fail the course.
Investigating plagiarism is an unpleasant experience for both the instructor
and the student. Please help us by avoiding any questionable behavior.

### Accommodation statement
