### Instructor's Description

This course explores both low- and high-level topics in software and systems
security. Many of these topics are advanced, and I have designed this course to
be challenging yet rewarding. The centerpiece of the course is a capture-the-flag-style challenge
system. Lectures will introduce a new topic related to software security, and
then challenge binaries will be released. These binaries will test your
knowledge and skill in detecting vulnerabilities in software and then
exploiting these vulnerabilities. Students who have participated in
capture-the-flag competitions will be familiar with this structure.
        

### Recommended Background

Binary exploitation, by nature, is difficult for many students. To exploit
software bugs, a student needs to have a solid understanding of how code is
executed. My goal is to equip each student with the tools and techniques needed
to understand, exploit, and protect actual binaries. However, I do expect a
certain level of baseline knowledge. Below, I list a few topics that students
should be comfortable with before taking this class.

The content of this course builds upon the foundation laid down in
undergraduate CS courses such as  *CS2303: Systems Programming Concepts*,
*CS2011: Machine Organization and Assembly Language*, and *CS3013: Operating
Systems.* It is expected that you already have a working knowledge of the
following tools and topics:

 - The basics of systems programming, including the C programming language,
   pointers, variable representations, and endianness.
 - The memory layout of C Programs, including the mechanics and purpose of the
   stack, heap, and code sections. 
 - The x86/x64 instruction set architecture, including an ability to read and
   understand assembly language.
 - Basics of operating systems, including system calls, virtual memory,
  threading, and permissions.
 - Familiarity with tools such as Bash and GDB.

It is highly recommended to review these topics, **especially C programming and
assembly** in the first week of class, as they are **critical** to completion
of the coursework.


## Course Policies and Procedures

The following represent the official policies and procedures for the course.
Please review this information and, if you have questions, discuss them with
me as soon as possible.

### Ethical Hacking Agreement

All students  must sign the [ethical hacking
agreement](https://cerebro.cs.wpi.edu/ethical_hacking/index.php) to acknowledge
that you will use the skills and knowledge you acquire in this course in an
ethical and legal manner.

### Official Communication

Class discussion, emails to the studentâ€™s WPI email account, the course
Discord, and the course web pages are avenues for official course communication.
Students are responsible for any information posted through these venues.

### Textbooks

We will not be using an assigned textbook in this course. Students will be
responsible for obtaining the reading from the links provided by the
instructor.

### Grading and Binary Challenges

Grades will be determined by the number of challenge points each student earns and their completion of mandatory challenges.
Challenges will be accessible via the course infrastructure. They will typically
involve exploiting a bug in a binary to obtain a *flag*. Students can enter this
flag into the course webpage to earn points for that challenge.

Challenges may cover various *categories*, including lecture practice, binary
exploitation, course participation, game exploitation, and others. The number
of points a challenge is worth serves as a rough estimate of the challenge's
difficulty.  Challenge flags are unique to each student, and the
exact steps needed to solve each challenge may depend on the student's
particular challenge instance.  

**Student independence.** Developing the skills to solve each of the challenges
requires completing assigned readings and videos, practicing with the
introduced tools, and independent exploration by the student. For example, a
challenge may require the student to read compiler documentation to understand
how factors, such as buffer size, might influence compilation. Further, the
student may need to seek out such documentation independently.

**Challenge time limits.** New challenges will be released throughout the
course as we cover more material. Students must solve a challenge prior to the
posted deadline to receive points. Some challenges (but not all) will remain
available for the entire duration of the course, e.g., participation
challenges. The challenge deadlines are displayed in the course infrastructure. 

**Challenge Sequences.** Some challenges will be available to solve only after you have solved the preceding challenges in the sequence. You can find such challenge sequences listed in the schedule. For instance, the first challenge sequence is listed as "Lecture Sequence: `stack0r-64`, `stack1r-64`, `stack2r-64`, and `stack3r-64`." Please note that challenges in a sequence unlock in the order they are listed, meaning you must solve `stack2r-64` to unlock `stack3r-64`. 

Additionally, challenges in a sequence tend to have the same due date.

It is important to note two additional items. First, failing to solve all challenges in a sequence will not directly impact challenges in other sequences. Second, challenge naming is not the same as a challenge sequence. For example, `stack4r-64` is not in the same sequence as `stack3r-32`.  Therefore, even if a student fails to solve `stack3r-32`, they may still submit a flag for `stack4r-32`. Although, as the challenge naming suggests, the teaching staff recommends solving the `stack3r-32` challenge before solving `stack4r-32`. 

**Challenge Unlocking.** Beyond the sequences described above, there may be additional requirements for unlocking challenges. For example, some challenges might only become available once the student has earned a certain number of points. Other challenges may only unlock on a specific date, while some challenges may be unlocked under mysterious circumstances.

It's important to note that all of these requirements are enforced by the infrastructure. In other words:
- If a student can see a challenge and submit a flag, they are eligible to receive points for it.
- If a student cannot see a challenge, it means they have not fulfilled the requirements to unlock it.
- If a student can see a challenge but cannot submit a flag, it means the deadline for that challenge has passed.

**Participation challenges.** There are various participation challenges that a
student can earn simply by helping improve the quality of the course. Before
working on any of the participation challenges, **students should contact me to
ensure that the work's scope is sufficient to earn points.** Also, as a bonus
for reading carefully, I recommend that you request to join the Hidden
classroom. 

**Student challenge submissions.** Once they have unlocked the `stockholm-syndrome` challenge, students are encouraged, but not required,
to submit new challenge binaries.  When submitting a new binary, please include
the source code, solution (e.g., as a python script), recommended point value,
recommended title, a makefile, description of the challenge, list of hints, and
a list of related challenges.  **Please contact me before starting
work on a new challenge.**

**Challenge difficulty.** The challenges are roughly divided into the following
difficulty levels: 

 - **Introductory:** Challenges with a score value between 0 and 75 points
   inclusive. 
 - **Basic:** Challenges with a score value between 76 and 150 points
   inclusive. 
 - **Intermediate:** Challenges with a score value between 151 and 300 points
   inclusive. Intermediate challenges will typically only unlock if you have at least 500 points.
 - **Advanced:** Challenges with a score value between 301 and 600 points
   inclusive. Advanced challenges will typically only unlock if you have at least 1500 points.
 - **Expert:** Challenges with a score value greater than 600 points. Expert challenges will typically only unlock if you have at least 3000 points.   

**Mandatory challenges.** There are some challenges  that students must solve
to pass the course to obtains a desired letter grade. These challenges are listed under the mandatory category.
One notable example is `the-bar`. To solve this challenge, the student must
understand all of the basic binary attacks introduced in the course.

**Letter grades.** The final letter grade will depend on the number of
challenge points earned by a student. I may adjust the particular point cutoff
for each grade based on the overall performance of the class; however, the
final cutoffs will be similar to the following:

 - **C:** 2000 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory
   challenges. This point value is roughly what you'd get by solving all
lecture challenges, the-bar, and two additional basic challenges. 
 - **B:** 3000 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory
   challenges. This value is roughly what you'd get by  solving all lecture
challenges, the-bar, two additional basic challenges, and five additional
intermediate challenges. **New in 2023.** To receive a B, a student must pass an oral final exam.
 - **A:** 4500 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory
   challenges. This value is roughly what you'd get by solving all lecture
challenges, the-bar, two additional basic challenges, seven additional
intermediate challenges, and two additional advanced challenges. **New in 2023.** To receive an A, a student must pass the B-level oral final and an additional A-level oral exam.

**Course Webpage.** All students must submit the challenge flags through the
course infrastructure web frontend, i.e., the course webpage. The course webpage includes a scoreboard that displays the
progress of your peers. When creating an account, your *username* must use your WPI username. However, you may choose to use
a pseudonym as your *display name*. **Students must also join the `CS4401-20XX`
classroom on the course webpage in order to view the challenges.** 

### Study Buddies

**New in 2023.** Students may denote 1 of their fellows as a study buddy for the duration of the course. 
Students may freely discuss challenge solutions with that buddy. 
Further, you may view and help debug each other's code. 
However, students may not directly give solution scripts to their buddy. 
Further, students may not, under any circumstances, provide a flag to their buddy. 

**Importantly, study buddies are not project partners.** 
Students may not employ a divide-and-conquer approach to the course challenges. 
I expect that all students should understand each challenge for which they submit a flag. 
Specifically, students should understand challenges to such a level that they would be able to walk through their solutions with me.  
If a student cannot demonstrate they understand a challenge for which they have submitted a flag, I will remove the points associated with that challenge (and potentially others). 

Please notify the course TA via Discord of your buddy selection. 


### CS4401 versus CS557

The first two-thirds of the graduate version of this course, CS557, overlaps
with the undergraduate version, CS4401. However, beyond that point, CS557 goes
into greater depth; for instance, the graduate course covers advanced heap
exploitation.


### Attacking the Course Infrastructure

Attacking the Course Infrastructure is strictly prohibited. Any attacks will be
met with appropriate disciplinary actions, including but not limited to,
failing the course and notifying the university and local law enforcement. If
you notice a flaw or potential exploit, please notify me directly and do not
attempt to exploit (or fix) it.

###  Professionalism

Students must treat each other and the teaching staff with respect at all
times. Disagreement, debates, and criticism of ideas are healthy aspects of
academic environments; however, students should be careful to avoid demeaning
language or personal attacks. The ability to handle conflict professionally and
work with a variety of people is an acquired skill, yet it is increasingly
important in technical careers.


### Academic Honesty 

Students should read and be familiar with [WPI's Academic Honesty
Policy](https://www.wpi.edu/about/policies/academic-integrity/dishonesty).  Any
suspected instance of academic dishonesty will be dealt with according to WPI
policies, which dictate that I report such instances to the Dean of Students.

**Do not provide your solutions to others, either directly or via some sort of
public posting. This includes public code repositories such as those found on
Github. This prohibition extends for the duration of the course. In other
words, even if the project deadline has passed, you may not post your solution
publicly at any point during the term. Doing so is a violation of the WPI's
prohibition against facilitating academic dishonesty.**

Likewise, students may not reference any previous versions of a course
assignment or project, regardless of how it is posted. If a student discovers
such a posting, they should report it to the instructor immediately, avoid the
resource in the future, and delete any copies that are cached on their
computer.

Cheating is usually the result of other problems in school. Please come see the
course staff if you are unable to keep up with the work for any reason, and we
will work something out. We want to see you succeed and will do everything we
can to help you out!

Your solution must always be your own work.  You may discuss course material
with others, but only during the lectures or via the public channels on the
course Discord server. Further, you may only share limited snippets of code in
the context of debugging.   When in doubt, contact me about whether a potential
action would be considered plagiarism. Also note that the facilitation of
plagiarism (giving your work to someone else) is academic dishonesty as well.

Plagiarism and other anti-intellectual behavior will be dealt with severely. If
you engage in academic dishonesty, you will almost certainly fail the course.
Investigating plagiarism is an unpleasant experience for both the instructor
and the student. Please help us by avoiding any questionable behavior.

### Accommodation statement

WPI is committed to providing an equal educational opportunity for all
students. If you have a documented physical, psychological, or learning
disability, you may be eligible for reasonable academic accommodations to help
you succeed in this course.
