### Instructor's Description

This course explores both low- and high-level topics in software and systems
security. The course will proceed along two distinct tracks: The *technical
track* will focus on gaining practical experience with attacks and defenses on
real software. The *discussion track* will explore high-level concepts and
understanding the broader picture. Many of these topics are advanced and this
course is designed to be challenging, yet rewarding.

The centerpiece of the technical track is a capture-the-flag-style challenge
system.  Lectures will introduce a new topic related to software security and
then challenge binaries will be released. These binaries will test your
knowledge and skill in detecting vulnerabilities in software and then
exploiting these vulnerabilities. Students who have participated in
capture-the-flag competitions will be familiar with this structure.

The technical track, by nature, is difficult for many students. In order to
exploit even the most basic bug, you need to have a good understanding of how
code is executed. My goal is to equip you with the tools and techniques needed
to understand, exploit, and protect real binaries. However, I do expect a
certain level of baseline knowledge. Here are a few topics that students should
be comfortable with prior to taking this class.

The discussion track will be student-led and focus on broader topics including
the economics of security, computer crime, usability, social issues, etc. Each
student will be expected to lead at least one discussion. This process will
involve identifying appropriate reading material, articulating discussion
questions, and providing a short introduction during class on the topic.        

### Recommended Background

The content of this course builds upon the foundation laid down in
undergraduate CS courses such as  *CS2303: Systems Programming Concepts*,
*CS2011: Machine Organization and Assembly Language*, and *CS3013: Operating
Systems.* It is expected that you already have a working knowledge of the
following tools and topics:

 - The basics of the systems programming, including the C programming language,
   pointers, variable representations, and endianness.
 - The memory layout of C Programs, including the mechanics and purpose of the
   stack, heap, and code sections. 
 - The x86/x64 instruction set architecture, including an ability to read and
   understand assembly language.
 - Basics of operating systems, including system calls, virtual memory,
  threading, and permissions
 - Familiarity with basic tools such as the Bash and GDB.

It is highly recommended to review these topics, **especially assembly language
and reverse-engineering** in the first week of class, as they are **critical**
to completion of the technical coursework.

We understand that many students may need a refresher on assembly language and
the x86 architecture, so here are some resources to review.

## Course Policies and Procedures

The following represent the official policies and procedures for the course.
Please review this information and, if you have questions, discuss them with
the professor as soon as possible.

### Ethical Hacking Agreement

All students  must sign the [ethical hacking
agreement](https://cerebro.cs.wpi.edu/ethical_hacking/index.php) to acknowledge
that you will not use the skills you acquire in this course to break the law. 

### Official Communication

Class discussion, class hand-outs, emails to the studentâ€™s WPI email account,
and the course Web pages are avenues for official course communication.
Students are responsible for any information posted through these venues.

Our class also has a **slack workspace** that you can turn to for additional
assistance from the TAs and other students from the class. [Here is the
invite link.](https://wpics4401.slack.com/join/signup)


### Lectures

This course leverages active learning rather than traditional lectures.  As
such, the lecture time will be used for activities such as student-led
discussion, challenge walkthroughs, and question session. I will hold a Zoom
meeting ([link](https://wpi.zoom.us/j/376441651)) during our scheduled lecture
time. I will also update the [course
schedule](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/logistics/schedule.html) before every
scheduled lecture (i.e., every Monday and Thursday) to include the course
material that will serve as the material for the lecture. My expectation is
that all students will go over the *required* material prior to the scheduled
lecture session. 

### Textbooks

We will not be using an assigned textbook in this course. Students will be
responsible for obtaining the reading from the links provided by the
instructor.

### Grading and Binary Challenges

Grades will be determined by the number of challenge points each student earns.
Challenges will be accessible via the course infrastructure and will often 
involve exploiting a bug in a binary to obtain a *flag*. This flag can be
entered into the course webpage to earn the points for that challenge. 

Challenges may cover a variety of categories including lecture practice, binary
exploitation, reverse-engineering, and course participation. In short,
different challenges will require different skills to solve, but the number of
points a challenge is worth denotes a challenge's relative difficulty. Note: 
these flags are unique to each student. Further, the exact steps needed to
solve each challenge will need to be tailored to the student's particular
challenge instance.  Finally, it is a bad idea to hoard flags as they may
expire after a few days! 

**Student independence.** Developing the skills to solve each of the challenges
will require completing assigned readings and videos, practicing with the
introduced tools, and, often, **independent exploration by the student.**  For
example, some challenges may require students to read the documentation for the
`gcc` compiler flags to understand how factors, such as buffer size, might
influence the compilation of the binary, even though such documentation is
never explicitly assigned by the instructor. 

**Challenge time limits.** Challenges will be released periodically as we cover
more material. Some challenges must be solved within a fixed amount of time to
receive points, e.g., the lecture challenges. While others will remain
available for the entire duration of the course. 

**Participation challenges.** There are a variety of participation challenges
that a student can earn simply by helping improve the quality of the course.
To obtain the flag for these challenges, the student needs to contact the
instructor via a slack direct message.  

**There are some challenges (e.g., the-bar) that must be solved in order to
pass the course.** These challenges are listed under the **mandatory**
category. The most notable example is `the-bar`.  In order to solve this
challenge, the student must understand all of the basic attacks introduced in
the course. Expect the-bar to be released a little after the halfway point in
the course.  

**Letter grades.** As stated above the final letter grade will depend on the
number of challenge points earned by a student. The particular point cutoff for
each grade will be adjusted based on the overall performance of the class;
however, the final cutoffs will be similar to the following:

 - **C:** 2000 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory challenges. This point
   value is roughly what you'd get by solving all lecture challenges plus the-bar. 
 - **B:** 3000 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory challenges. This value is
   roughly what you'd get by  solving all lecture challenges, the-bar, and five
other non-lecture challenges.
 - **A:** 4500 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory challenges. This value is
   roughly what you'd get by  solving all lecture challenges, the-bar, and ten 
other non-lecture challenges.

The total number of available points will be greater than 6500 once all
challenges are released.

**Course Webpage.**All students must submit the challenge flags through the
course webpage. **When creating an account, should use their WPI username,
e.g., `rjwalls`;** **Students must also join the `CS557` classroom with
teacher `rjwalls`.** If a student does not adhere to these two requirements,
the instructor will not be able to track the student's  progress and, thus,
they will not receive a grade.

### Attacking the Course Infrastructure

Attacking the Course Infrastructure is strictly prohibited. Any attacks will be
met with appropriate disciplinary actions, including but not limited to,
failing the course and notifying the university and local law enforcement. If
you notice a flaw or potential exploit, please notify me directly and do not
attempt to exploit (or fix) it.


###  Professionalism

Students must treat each other and the teaching staff with respect at all
times. Disagreement, debates, and criticism of ideas are healthy aspects of
academic environments; however, students should be careful to avoid demeaning
language or personal attacks. The ability to handle conflict professionally and
work with a variety of people is an acquired skill, yet it is increasingly
important in technical careers.


### Accommodation statement

Students with approved academic accommodations should plan to submit their
accommodation letters through the Office of Accessibility Services Student
Portal.  Should you have any questions about how accommodations can be
implemented in this particular course, please contact me as soon as possible. 
Students who are not currently registered with the Office of Accessibility
Services (OAS) but who would like to find out more information regarding
requesting accommodations and what that entails should plan to contact them via
email: AccessibilityServices@wpi.edu and/or via phone: (508) 831-4908.
 

### Academic Honesty
Students should read and be familiar with [WPI's Academic Honesty
Policy](https://www.wpi.edu/about/policies/academic-integrity/dishonesty).

Cheating is usually the result of other problems in school. Please come see the
course staff if you are unable to keep up with the work for any reason and we
will work something out. We want to see you succeed and will do everything we
can to help you out!

You may discuss material with others, but your code must be your own work.
When in doubt, contact the instructor about whether a potential action would be
considered plagiarism. **When discussing problems with others, do not show any
of your written or programmed solutions to others.** When asking others for
help, it is best to avoid taking direct notes about the solution other than to
jot down publicly available references.  Use only verbal communication (to the
extent possible).

Never misrepresent someone's work as your own. It must be absolutely clear what
material is your original work. You MUST cite all your sources properly. You
must remove any possibility of someone else's work from being misconstrued as
yours. Also note that the facilitation of plagiarism (giving your work to
someone else) is academic dishonesty as well.

Do not provide your solutions to others, either directly or via some sort of
public posting (e.g., on a Github public repository). Doing so is a violation
of the WPI's prohibition against facilitating academic dishonesty.

Plagiarism and other anti-intellectual behavior will be dealt with severely. If
you engage in academic dishonesty, you will almost certainly fail the course.
Investigating plagiarism is an unpleasant experience for both the instructor
and the student. Please help us by avoiding any questionable behavior.

### Submitting New Challenges

Students are encouraged, but not required, to submit new challenge binaries.
When submitting a new binary, please include the source code, solution (e.g.,
as a python script), recommended point value, recommended title, a makefile,
description of the challenge, list of hints, and a list of related challenges.  
**Please contact the instructor before starting work on a new challenge.**
