### Instructor's Description

This course explores both low- and high-level topics in software and systems
security. The course will proceed along two distinct tracks: The *technical
track* provides students with experience executing actual software attacks. The
*discussion track* explores high-level concepts and the broader implications of
security. Many of these topics are advanced, and I have designed this course to
be challenging yet rewarding.

The centerpiece of the technical track is a capture-the-flag-style challenge
system. Lectures will introduce a new topic related to software security, and
then challenge binaries will be released. These binaries will test your
knowledge and skill in detecting vulnerabilities in software and then
exploiting these vulnerabilities. Students who have participated in
capture-the-flag competitions will be familiar with this structure.

The discussion track will focus on broader topics, including the economics of
security, computer crime, usability, and social issues. I expect each student
to participate in the discussions. 
        

### Recommended Background

Binary exploitation, by nature, is difficult for many students. To exploit
software bugs, a student needs to have a solid understanding of how code is
executed. My goal is to equip each student with the tools and techniques needed
to understand, exploit, and protect actual binaries. However, I do expect a
certain level of baseline knowledge. Below, I list a few topics that students
should be comfortable with before taking this class.

The content of this course builds upon the foundation laid down in
undergraduate CS courses such as  *CS2303: Systems Programming Concepts*,
*CS2011: Machine Organization and Assembly Language*, and *CS3013: Operating
Systems.* It is expected that you already have a working knowledge of the
following tools and topics:

 - The basics of the systems programming, including the C programming language,
   pointers, variable representations, and endianness.
 - The memory layout of C Programs, including the mechanics and purpose of the
   stack, heap, and code sections. 
 - The x86/x64 instruction set architecture, including an ability to read and
   understand assembly language.
 - Basics of operating systems, including system calls, virtual memory,
  threading, and permissions
 - Familiarity with basic tools such as the Bash and GDB.

It is highly recommended to review these topics, **especially C programming and
assembly** in the first week of class, as they are **critical** to completion
of the technical coursework.


## Course Policies and Procedures

The following represent the official policies and procedures for the course.
Please review this information and, if you have questions, discuss them with
me as soon as possible.

### Ethical Hacking Agreement

All students  must sign the [ethical hacking
agreement](https://cerebro.cs.wpi.edu/ethical_hacking/index.php) to acknowledge
that you will use the skills and knowledge you acquire in this course in an
ethical and legal manner.


### Official Communication

Class discussion, emails to the studentâ€™s WPI email account,
and the course web pages are avenues for official course communication.
Students are responsible for any information posted through these venues.

Our class also has a **slack workspace** that you can turn to for additional
assistance from the TAs and other students from the class. [Here is the
invite link.](https://wpics4401.slack.com/join/signup)


### Textbooks

We will not be using an assigned textbook in this course. Students will be
responsible for obtaining the reading from the links provided by the
instructor.

### Grading and Binary Challenges

Grades will be determined by the number of challenge points each student earns.
Challenges will be accessible via the course infrastructure. They will often
involve exploiting a bug in a binary to obtain a *flag*. Students can enter this
flag into the course webpage to earn points for that challenge.

Challenges may cover various *categories*, including lecture practice, binary
exploitation, and course participation. The number of points a challenge is
worth serves as a rough estimate of the challenge's relative difficulty.
Challenge flags are unique to each student. Further, the exact steps needed to
solve each challenge may depend on the student's particular challenge instance.
Finally, it is a bad idea to hoard flags as they may expire after a few days!

**Challenge solutions.** Students must submit their solution files for all
mandatory and binary-exploitation challenges.  Students should email these
submissions directly to the course teaching assistant as a .ZIP file and
include all source code and a readme explaining how the student solved the
challenge. The student may be asked to explain their solution to the teaching
staff. 

**Student independence.** Developing the skills to solve each of the challenges
requires completing assigned readings and videos, practicing with the
introduced tools, and independent exploration by the student. For example, a
challenge may require the student to read compiler documentation to understand
how factors, such as buffer size, might influence compilation. Further, the
student may need to seek out such documentation independently.

**Challenge time limits.** New challenges will be released throughout the
course as we cover more material. Students must solve some challenges within a
relatively short amount of time to receive points, e.g., the lecture
challenges. Other challenges will remain available for the entire duration of
the course, e.g., participation challenges. I will announce the deadline for
each challenge as it is released. 

**Participation challenges.** There are various participation challenges that a
student can earn simply by helping improve the quality of the course. Before
working on any of the participation challenges, students should contact me to
ensure that the work's scope is sufficient to earn points. 

**Student challenge submissions.** Students are encouraged, but not required,
to submit new challenge binaries.  When submitting a new binary, please include
the source code, solution (e.g., as a python script), recommended point value,
recommended title, a makefile, description of the challenge, list of hints, and
a list of related challenges.  **Please contact the instructor before starting
work on a new challenge.**

**Mandatory challenges.** There are some challenges (e.g., the-bar) that
students must solve to pass the course. These challenges are listed under the
mandatory category. One notable example is the-bar. To solve this challenge,
the student must understand all of the basic attacks introduced in the course. 

**Letter grades.** The final letter grade will depend on the number of
challenge points earned by a student. I will adjust the particular point cutoff
for each grade based on the overall performance of the class; however, the
final cutoffs will be similar to the following:

 - **C:** 2000 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory challenges. This point
   value is roughly what you'd get by solving all lecture challenges plus the-bar. 
 - **B:** 3000 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory challenges. This value is
   roughly what you'd get by  solving all lecture challenges, the-bar, and five
other non-lecture challenges.
 - **A:** 4500 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory challenges. This value is
   roughly what you'd get by  solving all lecture challenges, the-bar, and ten 
other non-lecture challenges.

The total number of available points will be greater than 6500 once all
challenges are released.

**Course Webpage.**All students must submit the challenge flags through the
course webpage. **When creating an account, should use their WPI username,
e.g., `rjwalls`;** **Students must also join the `CS4401` classroom with
teacher `rjwalls`.** If a student does not adhere to these two requirements,
the instructor will not be able to track the student's  progress and, thus,
they will not receive a grade.

### Attacking the Course Infrastructure

Attacking the Course Infrastructure is strictly prohibited. Any attacks will be
met with appropriate disciplinary actions, including but not limited to,
failing the course and notifying the university and local law enforcement. If
you notice a flaw or potential exploit, please notify me directly and do not
attempt to exploit (or fix) it.


###  Professionalism

Students must treat each other and the teaching staff with respect at all
times. Disagreement, debates, and criticism of ideas are healthy aspects of
academic environments; however, students should be careful to avoid demeaning
language or personal attacks. The ability to handle conflict professionally and
work with a variety of people is an acquired skill, yet it is increasingly
important in technical careers.


### Academic Honesty 

Students should read and be familiar with [WPI's Academic Honesty
Policy](https://www.wpi.edu/about/policies/academic-integrity/dishonesty).  Any
suspected instance of academic dishonesty will be dealt with according to WPI
policies, which dictate that I report such instances to the Dean of Students.

**Do not provide your solutions to others, either directly or via some sort of
public posting. This includes public code repositories such as those found on
Github. This prohibition extends for the duration of the course. In other
words, even if the project deadline has passed, you may not post your solution
publicly at any point during the term. Doing so is a violation of the WPI's
prohibition against facilitating academic dishonesty.**

Likewise, students may not reference any previous versions of a course
assignment or project, regardless of how it is posted. If a student discovers
such a posting, they should report it to the instructor immediately, avoid the
resource in the future, and delete any copies that are cached on their
computer.


Cheating is usually the result of other problems in school. Please come see the
course staff if you are unable to keep up with the work for any reason and we
will work something out. We want to see you succeed and will do everything we
can to help you out!

You may discuss course material with others, but your code must be your own
work.  When in doubt, contact me about whether a potential action would be
considered plagiarism. **When discussing problems with others, do not show any
of your written or programmed solutions to others.** When asking others for
help, it is best to avoid taking direct notes about the solution other than to
jot down publicly available references.  

Never misrepresent someone's work as your own. It must be absolutely clear what
material is your original work. You MUST cite all your sources properly. You
must remove any possibility of someone else's work from being misconstrued as
yours. Also note that the facilitation of plagiarism (giving your work to
someone else) is academic dishonesty as well.

Plagiarism and other anti-intellectual behavior will be dealt with severely. If
you engage in academic dishonesty, you will almost certainly fail the course.
Investigating plagiarism is an unpleasant experience for both the instructor
and the student. Please help us by avoiding any questionable behavior.

### Accommodation statement
