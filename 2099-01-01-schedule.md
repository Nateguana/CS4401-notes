Below is a list of topics and lecture materials for this course. **Technical
materials** are best read **after** that day's lecture. The schedule below
should be considered a rough outline of what we will cover in the course.  It
will be adjusted throughout the semester. It was last updated on **August 23,
2022.**


### Lectures 01 and 02 

#### Topic: Introduction to the course and the basics of buffer overflows    

**Required materials:** Anything marked as "required" will directly help you
solve challenges and earn points. I expect you to have read all such materials. 
 - [Lecture Notes: Getting Started.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/getting_started.html) This set of notes lists what you should do to prepare for the first lecture. It
also introduces the course infrastructure and describes the recommended setup
for solving challenge binaries. In particular, it describes how to set up a
local container for running binaries, how to connect to the course shell server
and access challenge binaries, and how to submit flags.
 - [Course Syllabus](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/syllabus). Make
   sure to read all the way through. **Also be sure to sign the linked ethical
hacking agreement!** 
 - [Tips and Tricks for
   CS4401.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKxIn6N-kCi38WxOqNBXhxrZnOE9SVET) This playlist contains videos recorded by
   previous students of this course and covers what they think that you should
know before taking this course.  
 - [Lecture Notes: The Stack and Local Variables][lecture-binexec1]. 
 - [Lecture Notes: Basics of Buffer
   Overflows.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/basics_bufferoverflows.html)
These notes describe the basic concepts you need to start solving the `stack0`
challenge.
  
Optional: Other useful (and interesting) references:
 - LiveOverflow's ["How a CPU works and Introduction to
   Assembler"](https://youtu.be/6jSKldt7Eqs). This video provides a quick
refresher in case you are feeling rusty with the basics of assembly. It also
introduces important concepts like *control flow*, the *instruction pointer and
stack pointer registers*, the *push* and *pop* instructions, the *call
instruction*, and the *return instruction*.    
 - [Guide to x86 Assembly][x86asm]. This webpage is an invaluable reference for
   looking up the syntax and semantics of x86 assembly.
 - "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective," Bryant and O'Hallaron. This
   is the same textbook used in many undergraduate courses, so hopefully you
have a copy lying around already. This book has lots to offer, but I'd
recommend reviewing Chapter 3 to start.

### Lectures 03 and 04 

#### Topic: Buffer Overflows Continued

Required material:
 - [Lecture Notes: Memory Permissions, Register Spilling, and Other
Important Concepts.][notes_understanding_smashing]. Here I introduce (and
review) other concepts that are useful for understanding buffer overflows. Read
this before "Smashing the Stack For Fun and Profit." 
 - [Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit][smashing] by Aleph One. **Read from the Introduction section to the Buffer Overflow section. We will continue with the section on shell coding next time.**  This is a classic article that introduces the
basics of stack operation, calling conventions, and stack smashing.
 - [Quick Notes: Introducing 64-bit
   Binaries.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/quick/64bits.html)  These notes
highlight some of the conventions of 64-bit binaries.  
 - [Quick Notes: Intel vs. At&t
   syntax.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/quick/intel_v_att.html) You will be
exposed to both Intel and At&t syntax when looking as binary disassembly in
this course, so it is helpful to understand both.  
 - [Quick Notes: GDB
   Cheatsheet.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/quick/gdb.html) GDB is probably
the tool you will use the most in this course. 
 - [GEF documentation.](https://gef.readthedocs.io/en/master/) GEF is a very useful extension to GDB. 
 - [Quick Notes: Help: My Exploit Works in GDB, but not on the
   Server][quick-outsidegdb]
 - [Quick Notes: Printing in Python3.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/quick/python.html) Be careful when trying to use the print function in Python3!


[x86asm]:http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html

Optional material:
 - [Understanding environment
   variables](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Environment-Variables.html). If you are new to the concept of environment
variables---or just want to brush up a bit. This will be useful for solving `stack1`.

Required Material:
 - [Lecture Notes: Other Memory Errors][notes_memory]. I already posted these
   notes, but I am including them again as we did not have time to cover
them in lecture. 
 - [Lecture Notes: Global Offset Table][notes_got]. While our focus has been on
   manipulating stack-based code pointers, the global offset table is often a
great target if you have a write-what-where vulnerability.

Optional Material:
 - Izik's [treatise on abusing CTORS and DTORS][izik_ctor]

 - [Lecture Notes: Exploiting Malloc Unlinking][notes_malloc_unlinking]. 
 - ["The Heap: Once Upon a Free."][liveoverflow_dlmalloc1] from Liveoverflow. This video
covers the unlink issue with older versions of `dlmalloc`.  
 - ["The Heap: dlmalloc unlink() exploit."][liveoverflow_dlmalloc2]. This is
   the second of Liveoverflow's videos on unlinking and `dlmalloc`. 
   

Optional Material:
 - LiveOverflow's ["A simple Format String exploit
   example"][liveoverflow_format1]. This is an introductory video on
this topic. Much of the content of that video overlaps with the assigned
written notes.
 - LiveOverflow's ["Format String Exploit and overwrite the Global Offset
   Table"][liveoverflow_format2]. This video introduces some tricks that are
useful for making the format string vuln. more practical to exploit.
 - ["Format String to dump binary and gain RCE - 33c3ctf ESPR (pwn
   150)"][liveoverflow_format3]. This challenge is more difficult than the
challenges we see in class due to the lack of the binary. Fabian walks though
detecting a print format string vuln, how you can craft your input to verify
ASLR is disabled, and how to deal with null bytes in your input.

 - ["Understanding glibc malloc"][glibc_malloc]. While not directly related to
   security, to take a look at this writeup if you are interesting in learning
more about malloc. 
 - ["Heap Spraying Demystified"][heap_spraying]. This in-depth article
   introduces a technique used for  increasing the  chances of guessing an
unknown address by spraying the heap with the addresses of useful gadgets (`pop
rdi` for instance), nop sleds (`0x90`), and some shellcode.

   always need to hijack control-flow to exploit a program.   
 - ["Hacking Blind."][hacking_blind] by Bittau et al. This paper shows how to construct a ROP
   attack *without* access to the binary. You should not read every section
of this paper, instead focus on identifying and understanding the key ideas.

   of finding "one-gadgets", i.e., a single gadget that, by itself, can launch
a shell. 

Optional materials:
