Below is a list of topics and lecture materials for this course. **Required
materials** should be reviewed **prior** to that day's lecture. All
**synchronus components** will be conducted via Zoom during the scheduled
lecture time. 

Keep in mind that the schedule will be adjusted throughout the semester.
**Last update on Sept. 7, 2020.**


### Aug. 31, Monday 

Topic: Introduction to the course. Student introductions.   

Required materials:

 - [Course Syllabus](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/logistics/syllabus.html). Make
   sure to read all the way through. **Also be sure to sign the linked ethical
hacking agreement!**
 - [Lecture Notes: Old Man Glitch.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/oldman.html) You don't need to understand all of the specifics of this
   glitch, this is more of a motivating example for the course.  
 - [Lecture Notes: Introducing the Course Infrastructure](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/intro_infrastructure.html)
 - LiveOverflow's ["How a CPU works and Introduction to
   Assembler"](https://youtu.be/6jSKldt7Eqs). This video provides a quick
refresher in case you are feeling rusty with the basics of assembly. It also
introduces important concepts like *control flow*, the *instruction pointer and
stack pointer registers*, the *push* and *pop* instructions, the *call
instruction*, and the *return instruction*.    
 - [Guide to x86 Assembly][x86asm]. This webpage is an invaluable reference for
   looking up the syntax and semantics of x86 assembly. 

Optional: Other useful (and interesting) references:

 - "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective," Bryant and O'Hallaron. This
   is the same textbook used in many undergraduate courses, so hopefully you
have a copy lying around already. This book has lots to offer, but I'd
recommend reviewing Chapter 3 to start.    

**Released challenges:**
 - All of the participation challenges (Deadline: Dec. 7)
 - `Let's Discuss This` with deadline **December 7.** **This challenge must be
   solved in order to pass the course!**

Required material:
 - [Lecture Notes: Setting up your Local Environment for Challenge
   Solving.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/getting_started.html)
This video describes a simple local setup for solving challenge binaries. In
particular, it describes how to set up a local container for running binaries,
how to connect to the course shell server and access challenge binaries, and
how to submit flags.
 - [Lecture Notes: Basics of Buffer
   Overflows.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/basics_bufferoverflows.html)
These notes describe the basic concepts you need to start solving the `stack0`
challenge.

   syntax.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/quick/intel_v_att.html) You will be
exposed to both Intel and At&t syntax when looking as binary disassembly in
this course, so it is helpful to understand both.  
 - [Quick Notes: GDB
   Cheatsheet.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/quick/gdb.html) GDB is probably
the tool you will use the most in this course.

Optional material:
 - [Understanding environment
   variables](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Environment-Variables.html). If you are new to the concept of environment
variables---or just want to brush up a bit. This will be useful for solving `stack1`.

modern technology in order to protect the privacy rights of individuals," led
by Guin.

Required material:
 - ["Katz v. United States: Supreme Court Case, Arguments, Impact."][gg_katz]
   This describes the facts of the Katz v. United States Supreme Court case in
which a wiretap was used to record a private conversation in a public
phonebooth.  It presents the main standard for which the Fourth Amendment is
applied to various communications, called the Katz test, which requires both an
objective and subjective expectation of privacy.
 - ["The Fourth Amendment and Computers: Is a Computer Just Another Container
   or Are New Rules Required to Reflect New Technologies?"][gg_fourth] This
article is a summary of the most important issues related to applying the
Fourth Amendment and related case law to computers. It provides a set of topics
and relevant legal considerations on those topics to form a foundation for
discussing the Fourth Amendment in the context of electronic devices and
communication.
 - [SMITH v. MARYLAND.][gg_smith_maryland] This is a court opinion for a case
   in which the police had a telephone company install a pen register on
suspect’s phone, and were able to record the numbers he dialed. This search was
objected to by the defendant on Fourth Amendment grounds, and it is one of the
first cases to apply the doctrines of the Fourth Amendment to modern technology
such as phone communication.
 - [In Re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum, 670 F.3d 1335 (11th Cir.
   2012).][gg_in_re] This is a court opinion on a case where a suspect was
being compelled to decrypt the contents of his hard drive, but refused to do so
by invoking his Fifth Amendment right not to self-incriminate. It addresses the
question of whether or not decryption is a testimonial act that can be
compelled by the government, and what is being testified when a person performs
decryption such as entering a password on their personal computer.

Optional material:
 - [Discussion Questions.][gg_questions]

### Sept. 14, Monday.

Topic: Stack Smashing

Required material:
 - [Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit][smashing] by Aleph One. **Read from the Introduction section to the Buffer Overflow section. We will continue with the section on shell coding next time.**  This is a classic article that introduces the
basics of stack operation, calling conventions, and stack smashing. 
 - [Lecture Notes: The Stack and Local Variables][lecture-binexec1]. 
 - [Reversing and Cracking a first simple program][liveoverflow05]. This video
   covers the basics of reverse engineering a disassembled binary, including
how to visualize the control flow of a program (with pen and paper!).
 - [Simple Tools and Techniques for Reversing a Binary][liveoverflow06]. A
   follow up to the previous video that introduces some tools that are useful
for reverse engineering. Note, Radare2 (covered in the video) is a daunting
tool to learn. I recommend using [Ghidra][ghidra] instead.  

 Optional material:

### Sept. 17, Thursday

Topic: "Discussion: adversarial attacks on machine learning systems," led by
Galen.

Required material:
 - ["Slight Street Sign Modifications Can Completely Fool Machine Learning
   Algorithms"][gg_ackerman]. A non-technical overview of a white box
adversarial attack, showing how such an attack could be carried out in the real
world. In this particular attack, researchers were able to make slight
alterations to physical street signs that interfered with algorithmic
identification, but were not obviously malicious to human observers.
 - ["This Neural Net Hallucinates Sheep"][gg_shane]. This article describes a
   particular type of errors with a single ML based computer vision system, and
explores why machine learning is prone to this kind of mistake. In particular,
it addresses one reason why ML often works well and then suddenly makes
mistakes that seem absurd to humans.
- ["Adversarial Attacks and Defences: A Survey"][gg_chakraborty]. This is a
   survey paper of recent developments in adversarial attacks on machine
learning systems and defenses that have been developed against them. It has
both technical details on how attacks and defenses are carried out (which you
should read one or two to get a feel for and then skim) as well as overviews of
which strategies are still considered effective and which ones have proven
unhelpful.

Optional materials:
 - [Discussion Questions.][gb_questions]
 - [Researchers Fooled a Google AI Into Thinking a Rifle Was a
   Helicopter][gg_matsakis]. This article describes an attack very similar to
the street sign article, but performed on a black box system---one the
attackers had no internal access to. As you read, think about how the writer
describes the computer vision system: are they anthropomorphizing it? Is that
helpful or harmful?
 - [Watson Medical Algorithm][gg_munroe]. A visual representation of some of
   the decision making processes underlying current state of the art medical
machine learning systems. An excellent primer on the steps already being taken
to minimize harm in complex systems with potentially faulty algorithms.
