Below is a list of topics and lecture materials for this course. **Required
materials** should be reviewed **prior** to that day's lecture. All
**synchronus components** will be conducted via Zoom during the scheduled
lecture time. 

Keep in mind that the schedule will be adjusted throughout the semester.
**Last update on August 31, 2020.**


### Aug. 31, Monday 

Synchronous Component: Introduction to the course. Student introductions.   

Required materials:

 - [Course Syllabus](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/logistics/syllabus.html). Make
   sure to read all the way through. **Also be sure to sign the linked ethical
hacking agreement!**
 - [Lecture Notes: Old Man Glitch.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/oldman.html) You don't need to understand all of the specifics of this
   glitch, this is more of a motivating example for the course.  
 - [Lecture Notes: Introducing the Course Infrastructure](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/intro_infrastructure.html)
 - LiveOverflow's ["How a CPU works and Introduction to
   Assembler"](https://youtu.be/6jSKldt7Eqs). This video provides a quick
refresher in case you are feeling rusty with the basics of assembly. It also
introduces important concepts like *control flow*, the *instruction pointer and
stack pointer registers*, the *push* and *pop* instructions, the *call
instruction*, and the *return instruction*.    
 - [Guide to x86 Assembly][x86asm]. This webpage is an invaluable reference for
   looking up the syntax and semantics of x86 assembly. 

Optional: Other useful (and interesting) references:

 - "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective," Bryant and O'Hallaron. This
   is the same textbook used in many undergraduate courses, so hopefully you
have a copy lying around already. This book has lots to offer, but I'd
recommend reviewing Chapter 3 to start.    

**Released challenges:**
 - All of the participation challenges (Deadline: Dec. 7)
 - `Let's Discuss This` with deadline **December 7.** **This challenge must be
   solved in order to pass the course!**

#### Oct. 26, Monday 

Required material:
 - [Lecture Notes: Basics of Format String Vulnerabilities][notes_format] 
 - LiveOverflow's ["A simple Format String exploit

   Table"][liveoverflow_format2]. This video introduces some tricks that are
useful for making the format string vuln. more practical to exploit. 

Optional Material:

   150)"][liveoverflow_format3]. This challenge is more difficult than the
challenges we see in class due to the lack of the binary. Fabian walks though
detecting a print format string vuln, how you can craft your input to verify
ASLR is disabled, and how to deal with null bytes in your input.

 - ["Understanding glibc malloc"][glibc_malloc]. While not directly related to
   security, to take a look at this writeup if you are interesting in learning
more about malloc. 
 - ["Heap Spraying Demystified"][heap_spraying]. This in-depth article
   introduces a technique used for  increasing the  chances of guessing an
unknown address by spraying the heap with the addresses of useful gadgets (`pop
rdi` for instance), nop sleds (`0x90`), and some shellcode.
