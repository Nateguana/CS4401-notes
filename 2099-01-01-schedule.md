 - [Lecture Notes: Setting up your Local Environment for Challenge
   Solving.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/getting_started.html)
This video describes a simple local setup for solving challenge binaries. In
particular, it describes how to set up a local container for running binaries,
how to connect to the course shell server and access challenge binaries, and
how to submit flags.
  

Optional: Other useful (and interesting) references:
 - LiveOverflow's ["How a CPU works and Introduction to
   Assembler"](https://youtu.be/6jSKldt7Eqs). This video provides a quick
refresher in case you are feeling rusty with the basics of assembly. It also
introduces important concepts like *control flow*, the *instruction pointer and
stack pointer registers*, the *push* and *pop* instructions, the *call
instruction*, and the *return instruction*.    
 - [Guide to x86 Assembly][x86asm]. This webpage is an invaluable reference for
   looking up the syntax and semantics of x86 assembly.
 - "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective," Bryant and O'Hallaron. This
   is the same textbook used in many undergraduate courses, so hopefully you
have a copy lying around already. This book has lots to offer, but I'd
recommend reviewing Chapter 3 to start.

### Lecture 07 

#### Topic: Guest Lecture 

**Title:** "Fuzzing for profit: from crashes to vulnerabilities"

**Speaker:** [Mathias Payer](https://nebelwelt.net/).

**Abstract:** Fuzzing has emerged as the de-facto standard to find software bugs.
While research focuses on better guiding the fuzzer through improved
feedback, setting up fuzzing campaigns has never been easier. It's as
simple as compiling the code-under-test and then letting the fuzzer
explore the code. Analysts can improve the fuzzing by providing targeted
starting seeds or, ideally, by writing custom fuzzer stubs that exercise
the functionality of interest. The result of the fuzzing campaign are
crashing seeds that trigger bugs. The analyst then has to triage and
group these crashes into individual bugs. Given that there may be
thousands of crashes for each bug, triaging and grouping requires
careful attention.

After a quick overview of the research frontier and remaining challenges
in fuzzing, we will focus on minimizing developer efforts to set up
fuzzing campaigns along with discussing trade-offs between defensive and
offensive fuzzing---the former tries to find as many bugs as possible
during software development, while the latter tries to discover
exploitable bugs for, e.g., bug bounties.


### Lecture 08

#### Topic of Discussion: IoT Security and Privacy Concerns

Discussion material:
  - ["What is IoT?"][bm_iot]. For anyone who might not completely understand 
	or needs to refresh their knowledge on what IoT is and the application for 
	these devices, this is a necessary read. It also dives into the security 
	and privacy related issues for these devices, and the vulnerabilities of 
	these devices based on the device's real-world applications.
  - ["Top 10 Biggest IoT Security Issues"][bm_sec]. Offers a broad description 
	of the top 10 security-related issues with IoT devices. It paints a big 
	picture for both security and privacy concerns in IoT devices and is 
	necessary to understand why these devices are so vulnerable.
  - ["How teen scammers and CCTV cameras almost brought down the internet"][bm_hack]. On October 12, 2016, a massive distributed denial of service 
	attack left much of the internet inaccessible on the U.S. east coast. The 
	attack, which authorities initially feared was the work of a hostile 
	nation-state, was in fact the work of the Mirai botnet which took advantage 
	of thousands of IoT devices to form the ultimate weapon.
   - ["Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020"][bm_bill]. 
    Days before taking a week-long Thanksgiving recess, the US Senate passed 
    an almost mundane cybersecurity bill that, if approved by the President, 
    will improve security guidelines and protocols for Internet of Things 
    devices purchased and owned by the Federal government.
  - ["Banned In Germany: Kids' Doll Is Labeled An Espionage Device"][bm_doll].
	A doll called My Friend Cayla listens a little too well; the toy is 
	essentially a stealthy espionage device that shares what it hears and is 
	also vulnerable to takeover by third parties. There is a video within 
	the article that is a necessary watch.
  - ["Romanian hackers took over D.C. surveillance cameras just before presidential inauguration"][bm_cam]. Romanian hackers took over two-thirds 
	of the District's outdoor surveillance cameras just before President 
	Trump's inauguration. Example of the possible political weapons or 
	censorship these devices might be capable of if exploited.
  - ["FDA confirms that St. Jude's cardiac devices can be hacked"][bm_fda].
	The FDA confirmed that St. Jude Medical's implantable cardiac devices have 
	vulnerabilities that could allow a hacker to access a device. Once in, 
	they could deplete the battery or administer incorrect pacing or shocks.
	This is a strong example of how implementing poorly secure IoT devices in 
	healthcare could have dire consequences. 

Optional material:
  - ["Defenseless internet 'paying the price' for ignoring security"][bm_hack2].
	A different perspective and summary of the Mirai botnet attack. Short summary 
	of the attack, and the perspective as to why it happened and why it can easily 
	happen again.
  - ["Amazon has a fix for Alexa's creepy laughs"][bm_alexa]. This article describes 
	the random creepy laughter of amazon Alexa capable devices. This was not so much 
	a cause from a security flaw, but poor user-feedback design, which was fixed. It 
	portrays the creepiness of devices that we rely on so much for information and convenience. 
  - ["'Child's Play' trailer shows Chucky controlling smart homes and drones"][bm_child]. 
	Short article with a trailer of the new Child's Play movie, that portrays the modern horror 
	doll as an internet-connected device that is capable of controlling other such devices. 
	Just imagine a hacker doing the same; it is possible, and scary to think about, especially 
	given the security posture of most of these devices.

#### Topic of Discussion: Online Censorship and How Governments Police the Internet

Discussion material:

  - ["Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act"][jp_sec230]. A nice summary
	of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects ISPs and
	other online platforms from being liable for user-generated content. Note
	that Section 230 also protects online platforms from liability for
	_removing_ material they find objectionable, "whether or not such material
	is constitutionally protected."
  - ["Copyright in the Age of YouTube"][jp_cy]. This article is a bit older, but
	much of it is still relevant today. Section 512 of the DMCA provides a
	"safe harbor" to online platforms as long as they act "expeditiously" to
	remove copyright-infringing material once they are notified of it.
  - ["The great firewall of China: Xi Jinping’s internet shutdown"][jp_china].
	China maintains strict control over the Internet within its borders, in
	part by requiring ISPs to ensure that packets that flow through their data
	centers are lawful.
  - ["Kazakhstan’s Robin Hood: The Geopolitics of Sci-Hub"][jp_sh]. The website
	Sci-Hub hosts hundreds of thousands of research papers that are normally
	locked behind paywalls for free. This provides access to scientific
	journals to people who would not normally be able to afford it, but also
	denies publishers and researchers potential revenue from lost sales. Note
	that Sci-Hub has been successfully sued by publishers in the U.S., but did
	not respond to court orders because it is hosted overseas.
  - ["Bipartisan Bill Targets Drugs, Terrorist Content Online"][jp_bill]. This
	bill, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, would require online
	platforms to report content dealing with illegal activity, including drugs,
	hate crimes, murder, and terrorism.

Optional material:

  - [Discussion Questions.][jp_questions]
  - ["The Move to the Middle: The Enduring Threat of “Harmful” Speech to the End-to-End Principle"][jp_e2e]. This 2006 article describes some of the
	ways U.S. regulation has shifted from end nodes (outlawing particular
	activities) to the middle (requiring intermediaries to block or inspect
	certain packets), violating the end-to-end principle.
  - ["Digital piracy costs US economy $30bn annually"][jp_cost]. The Chamber of
	Commerce estimates the cost of digital piracy in the U.S. alone to be
	almost \$30 billion a year.
  - ["Three Charged With Leaking Movies as Part of Global Piracy Ring"][jp_sparks]. Three members of a global piracy group were arrested in
	August for cracking DRM on DVD and Blu-ray discs to leak movies and TV
	shows before they were officially released. They could face up to 30 years
	in prison if convicted.

#### Topic of Discussion: Container Security 

Discussion Material:

- [What is a Container?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnJ7qX9fkcU). To secure containers, it’s essential to understand what they are and their lifecycle. This is an introduction to concepts and terminology.
- [Ten layers of container security](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/container-security-openshift-cloud-devops-whitepaper). Behind this RedHat advertisement is a comprehensive high-level take on container security. Focus on items 1 to 5, especially item 1, where it describes the mechanisms containers use for isolation.
- [A Measurement Study on Linux Container Security: Attacks and Countermeasures](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3274694.3274720). In this paper, the authors run a set of kernel exploits against containers and see which ones are blocked. Read the abstract, section 2, and section 4. The takeaway is that the primary isolation mechanisms of containers (namespaces and cgroups) are less effective at blocking these exploits than other security mechanisms (SELinux, seccomp, capabilities).
- [Malicious Docker Hub Container Images Used for Cryptocurrency Mining](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/in/security/news/virtualization-and-cloud/malicious-docker-hub-container-images-cryptocurrency-mining). This article provides an example of a non-runtime attack, where the attacker uploads a malicious image to a publicly available registry, using a common name to trick developers into using it.
- [Notes on Monolithic Kernels and Virtual Machine Managers](http://web.mit.edu/6.033/2017/wwwdocs/lec/l06.pdf). These notes explain why the kernel, and therefore containers, provide a weaker security guarantee than virtual machines. The gist is that the monolithic architecture of Linux makes it easier to introduce bugs. Keep in mind that isolation is only one aspect of security.


Optional Material:

- [chroot](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chroot.2.html), [namespaces](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html), [cgroups](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html), [capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html). Man-pages for the various kernel features that make up a container.
- [Hundreds of Vulnerable Docker Hosts Exploited by Cryptocurrency Miners](https://www.imperva.com/blog/hundreds-of-vulnerable-docker-hosts-exploited-by-cryptocurrency-miners/). An extreme example of the dangers of the Docker daemon. Since it runs as root and allows you to create containers, access to it essentially gives you root. In this case, the author finds the daemon publicly exposed on hosts throughout the Internet, and it’s no surprise that many of them are running crypto-miners.
- [Breaking out of Docker via runC – Explaining CVE-2019-5736](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/breaking-docker-via-runc-explaining-cve-2019-5736/). A vulnerability in runC (the program that directly creates containers) that illustrates that root inside the container is very similar to root outside (at least for Docker). The details can be skimmed, but focus on the last part about Privileged Containers.
- [gVisor Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJJT8wc0T_c). gVisor is a container runtime that provides a proxy syscall interface to reduce the attack surface of the kernel for untrusted containers.
- [How AWS’s Firecracker virtual machines work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIRv2FnHJAg). Firecracker is a middle ground between containers and virtual machines, using a slimmed down VM to get fast startup times and low overhead, while keeping the security benefits of VMs.
