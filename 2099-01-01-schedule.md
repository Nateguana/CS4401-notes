Below is a list of topics and lecture materials for this course. **Required
materials** should be reviewed **prior** to that day's lecture. All
**synchronus components** will be conducted via Zoom during the scheduled
lecture time. 

Keep in mind that the schedule will be adjusted throughout the semester.
**Last update on Oct. 28, 2020.**


### Aug. 31, Monday 

Topic: Introduction to the course. Student introductions.   

Required materials:

 - [Course Syllabus](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/logistics/syllabus.html). Make
   sure to read all the way through. **Also be sure to sign the linked ethical
hacking agreement!**
 - [Lecture Notes: Old Man Glitch.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/oldman.html) You don't need to understand all of the specifics of this
   glitch, this is more of a motivating example for the course.  
 - [Lecture Notes: Introducing the Course Infrastructure](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/intro_infrastructure.html)
 - LiveOverflow's ["How a CPU works and Introduction to
   Assembler"](https://youtu.be/6jSKldt7Eqs). This video provides a quick
refresher in case you are feeling rusty with the basics of assembly. It also
introduces important concepts like *control flow*, the *instruction pointer and
stack pointer registers*, the *push* and *pop* instructions, the *call
instruction*, and the *return instruction*.    
 - [Guide to x86 Assembly][x86asm]. This webpage is an invaluable reference for
   looking up the syntax and semantics of x86 assembly. 

Optional: Other useful (and interesting) references:

 - "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective," Bryant and O'Hallaron. This
   is the same textbook used in many undergraduate courses, so hopefully you
have a copy lying around already. This book has lots to offer, but I'd
recommend reviewing Chapter 3 to start.

   This describes the facts of the Katz v. United States Supreme Court case in
which a wiretap was used to record a private conversation in a public
phonebooth.  It presents the main standard for which the Fourth Amendment is
applied to various communications, called the Katz test, which requires both an
objective and subjective expectation of privacy.

### Sept. 17, Thursday

Topic: "Discussion: adversarial attacks on machine learning systems," led by
Galen.

Required material:
 - ["Slight Street Sign Modifications Can Completely Fool Machine Learning
   Algorithms"][gg_ackerman]. A non-technical overview of a white box
adversarial attack, showing how such an attack could be carried out in the real
world. In this particular attack, researchers were able to make slight
alterations to physical street signs that interfered with algorithmic
identification, but were not obviously malicious to human observers.
 - ["This Neural Net Hallucinates Sheep"][gg_shane]. This article describes a
   particular type of errors with a single ML based computer vision system, and
explores why machine learning is prone to this kind of mistake. In particular,
it addresses one reason why ML often works well and then suddenly makes
mistakes that seem absurd to humans.
- ["Adversarial Attacks and Defences: A Survey"][gg_chakraborty]. This is a
   survey paper of recent developments in adversarial attacks on machine
learning systems and defenses that have been developed against them. It has
both technical details on how attacks and defenses are carried out (which you
should read one or two to get a feel for and then skim) as well as overviews of
which strategies are still considered effective and which ones have proven
unhelpful.

Optional materials:
 - [Discussion Questions.][gb_questions]
 - [Researchers Fooled a Google AI Into Thinking a Rifle Was a Helicopter][gg_matksakis]. This article describes an attack very similar to
the street sign article, but performed on a black box system---one the
attackers had no internal access to. As you read, think about how the writer
describes the computer vision system: are they anthropomorphizing it? Is that
helpful or harmful?
 - [Watson Medical Algorithm][gg_munroe]. A visual representation of some of
   the decision making processes underlying current state of the art medical
machine learning systems. An excellent primer on the steps already being taken
to minimize harm in complex systems with potentially faulty algorithms.

### Oct. 22, Thursday

Topic: "Discussion: Online Censorship and How Governments Police the Internet"
led by Joe Petitti.

Required material:

  - ["Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act"][jp_sec230]. A nice summary
	of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects ISPs and
	other online platforms from being liable for user-generated content. Note
	that Section 230 also protects online platforms from liability for
	_removing_ material they find objectionable, "whether or not such material
	is constitutionally protected."
  - ["Copyright in the Age of YouTube"][jp_cy]. This article is a bit older, but
	much of it is still relevant today. Section 512 of the DMCA provides a
	"safe harbor" to online platforms as long as they act "expeditiously" to
	remove copyright-infringing material once they are notified of it.
  - ["The great firewall of China: Xi Jinping’s internet shutdown"][jp_china].
	China maintains strict control over the Internet within its borders, in
	part by requiring ISPs to ensure that packets that flow through their data
	centers are lawful.
  - ["Kazakhstan’s Robin Hood: The Geopolitics of Sci-Hub"][jp_sh]. The website
	Sci-Hub hosts hundreds of thousands of research papers that are normally
	locked behind paywalls for free. This provides access to scientific
	journals to people who would not normally be able to afford it, but also
	denies publishers and researchers potential revenue from lost sales. Note
	that Sci-Hub has been successfully sued by publishers in the U.S., but did
	not respond to court orders because it is hosted overseas.
  - ["Bipartisan Bill Targets Drugs, Terrorist Content Online"][jp_bill]. This
	bill, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, would require online
	platforms to report content dealing with illegal activity, including drugs,
	hate crimes, murder, and terrorism.

Optional material:

  - [Discussion Questions.][jp_questions]
  - ["The Move to the Middle: The Enduring Threat of “Harmful” Speech to the End-to-End Principle"][jp_e2e]. This 2006 article describes some of the
	ways U.S. regulation has shifted from end nodes (outlawing particular
	activities) to the middle (requiring intermediaries to block or inspect
	certain packets), violating the end-to-end principle.
  - ["Digital piracy costs US economy $30bn annually"][jp_cost]. The Chamber of
	Commerce estimates the cost of digital piracy in the U.S. alone to be
	almost \$30 billion a year.
  - ["Three Charged With Leaking Movies as Part of Global Piracy Ring"][jp_sparks]. Three members of a global piracy group were arrested in
	August for cracking DRM on DVD and Blu-ray discs to leak movies and TV
	shows before they were officially released. They could face up to 30 years
	in prison if convicted.
