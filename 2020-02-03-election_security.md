### Discussion Questions

Why introduce electronics into the voting system?
 - What are the benefits and disadvantages of electronic voting?
 - Are there reasonable alternatives?

What are some exploits that can be performed on offline, computerized voting
systems?
 - How do the exploits compare between a system like India uses and something
   more likely to be found in the US?
 - How can these be mitigated?
 - What seems most likely to occur in the United States?

Should the federal government require specific voting standards?
 - What should they be?

What makes online voting harder than online shopping?
 - Is there a difference in how an adversary would attack electronic vs
   networked voting?

Online voting can be used to address accessibility problems, due to both
disabilities and global events.  Is this a reasonable justification for its use
in future elections?
