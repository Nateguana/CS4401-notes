Topic: "Discussion: Tools and Techniques for Writing Secure Code," led
by Roger.

Required material:
  - ["Security Bugs are Fundamentally Different Than Quality Bugs"][rw_securitybugs]. Provides an overview of software testing, quality assurance, and different kinds of software bugs.
  - ["How to Cyber Security: Fuzzing does not mean random"][rw_fuzzing]. This article gives a background and introduction to fuzzing before going into modern examples. Several different fuzzing methodologies are discussed as well.
  - ["Software Security for Open Source Systems"][rw_opensource]. This paper covers several challenges to open source software and surveys enhancements that attempt to address existing security concerns for open source software.
  - [Risky Biz Podcast #406, "Making a Killing From Bug Bounty Programs"][rw_riskybugbounty]. Skip to the interview at 22:20. An interesting interview that provides and inside look at bug bounty programs, those who participate in them, and what to expect from them.
  - [Secure Code Reviews][rw_codereviewmitre].  MITRE's publication outlining the best practices to conduct code review for quality assurance.

Optional Material:
 - ["Github Rolls Out New Code Scanning Security Features to all Users"][rw_github]. New code scanning feature analyzes every pull request for known vulnerabilities and problematic source code and prompts users to revise code.
 - ["Bug bounties: A good tool, but donâ€™t make them the only tool in security"][rw_bugbounty]. An article providing a high level overview of bug bounty programs and examines the pros and cons of these programs.
 - [Synopsys Code Review Glossary][rw_codereview]. Broad overview and introduction to the code reviewing process.
 - ["Why fuzzing is your friend for DevSecOps"][rw_fuzzing2]. An article demonstrating the value of effectively utilizing fuzzing when evaluating software security.

### Discussion Questions

Why are software vulnerabilities important?

Why do software bugs regularly occur?

How can we write better code?
 + What does better mean? Less bugs, more secure?
 + What tools or resources exist to address this problem?

What does fuzzing provide to enhance software security?
 + Is the complexity of the technique worth the rewards?

Is open source code secure? Can it be trusted?
 + Does more visibility into the codebase make a product more secure?

Are bug bounties helpful and worthwhile for companies to pursue?
 + Can security researchers make a living from bug bounties?
 + Are bug bounties ethical?
 + How do you ensure responsible disclosure in bug bounty programs?

Are code reviews a beneficial use of employees time?
