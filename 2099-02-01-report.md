We are receiving reports of several strange objects that have crashed to the Earth, making landfall in Worcester, Massachusetts. The first appears to be a spaceship of some sort, having landed at latitude 42.■■■■■ and longitude -71.■■■■■. Agency sources claim to have seen living, cat-like creatures in the wreckage, arguing about "misconfigured navigation" and "sideswiping Pluto" and "all systems going haywire". 

The second object is a large box that has appeared in the Computer Science building at WPI, appearing to be a claw machine. We suspect this machine is connected to the appearance of the ship, but have no proof as of yet. 

It is likely that WPI students will interact with this machine, and perhaps the alien beings, before we have a chance to properly investigate. It is recommended that Agency members proceed with curiosity, yet caution.
