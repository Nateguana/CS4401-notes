Topic: "Discussion: Online Censorship and How Governments Police the Internet"


Required material:

  - ["Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act"][jp_sec230]. A nice summary
	of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects ISPs and
	other online platforms from being liable for user-generated content. Note
	that Section 230 also protects online platforms from liability for
	_removing_ material they find objectionable, "whether or not such material
	is constitutionally protected."
  - ["Copyright in the Age of YouTube"][jp_cy]. This article is a bit older, but
	much of it is still relevant today. Section 512 of the DMCA provides a
	"safe harbor" to online platforms as long as they act "expeditiously" to
	remove copyright-infringing material once they are notified of it.
  - ["The great firewall of China: Xi Jinping’s internet shutdown"][jp_china].
	China maintains strict control over the Internet within its borders, in
	part by requiring ISPs to ensure that packets that flow through their data
	centers are lawful.
  - ["Kazakhstan’s Robin Hood: The Geopolitics of Sci-Hub"][jp_sh]. The website
	Sci-Hub hosts hundreds of thousands of research papers that are normally
	locked behind paywalls for free. This provides access to scientific
	journals to people who would not normally be able to afford it, but also
	denies publishers and researchers potential revenue from lost sales. Note
	that Sci-Hub has been successfully sued by publishers in the U.S., but did
	not respond to court orders because it is hosted overseas.
  - ["Bipartisan Bill Targets Drugs, Terrorist Content Online"][jp_bill]. This
	bill, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, would require online
	platforms to report content dealing with illegal activity, including drugs,
	hate crimes, murder, and terrorism.

Optional material:

  - ["The Move to the Middle: The Enduring Threat of “Harmful” Speech to the End-to-End Principle"][jp_e2e]. This 2006 article describes some of the
	ways U.S. regulation has shifted from end nodes (outlawing particular
	activities) to the middle (requiring intermediaries to block or inspect
	certain packets), violating the end-to-end principle.
  - ["Digital piracy costs US economy $30bn annually"][jp_cost]. The Chamber of
	Commerce estimates the cost of digital piracy in the U.S. alone to be
	almost \$30 billion a year.
  - ["Three Charged With Leaking Movies as Part of Global Piracy Ring"][jp_sparks]. Three members of a global piracy group were arrested in
	August for cracking DRM on DVD and Blu-ray discs to leak movies and TV
	shows before they were officially released. They could face up to 30 years
	in prison if convicted.

### Discussion Questions

Is the Internet a global resource?
  - Should any one country have the right to police the entire Internet?
  - What about just sites that have servers located within the country?

Should intermediaries be responsible for content they merely pass along through
the network?

  - Should social networks be required to remove illegal user content, such as
	copyrighted works or threats of violence? What about content that is
	distasteful, but not strictly illegal (like some kinds of hate speech)?
  - Where should the line be drawn between 
  - How does end-to-end encryption play into this? Can a network intermediary
	be held responsible for content they can't decrypt?
  - If a website voluntarily censors legal content, should they still have the
	protection of Section 230?
  - Where should the line be drawn between a site that simply hosts
	user-generated content (like Twitter) and a "publisher" which is
	responsible for its own content?

Candidates from both major parties support restricting liability protections
for online platforms. Will this be a net positive or negative for society?

Does the first amendment protect these types of content as free speech, or
should the government remove them for greater public good?

  - Copyrighted material
  - Hate speech, Holocaust denial, etc.
  - "Fake news", or false information posted in an attempt to interfere with an
	elections
  - Threats of violence
  - Instructions for 3D-printing guns or making bombs
  - Content that supports human trafficking
  - Child pornography

Is speech on the Internet different from speech in real life? How so?

How can we balance fair use with protecting copyright? Should content providers
be required to take down copyright-infringing material once they are notified
of it?

  - Is protecting copyright holders important enough to justify the risk of
	hurting free speech with automated systems, as in YouTube?
  - Should websites knowingly hosting user-submitted copyright-infringing
	material, like The Pirate Bay, be shut down?
  - Are sites like Sci-Hub a net positive or negative to society? Is piracy a
	victimless crime, or an economic threat to artists and content producers?

China censors and blocks foreign Internet platforms to protect the economic
interests of their own companies. Should the U.S. do the same, e.g. by banning
Chinese tech companies like TikTok and WeChat?
