### Discussion Questions

Would you let a video game install kernel level anti-cheat on your pc?
 - Does how bad you want to play the game affect your answer?
 - Does it depend on who the game publisher is?

Should video game developers be allowed to use kernel-level anti-cheat?
 - Should there be a limit on the extent to which anti-cheat methods can be implemented?
 - Do you think anti-cheat methods have gone too far?

In all the games you\'ve played, how often have you noticed the anti-cheat?
 - Did it impact your playing experience?
 - Have you ever considered a game's anti-cheat measures before buying it?
 - Did it ever make you not download a game?

The first article has a graphic representing survey results on cheating.
 - Were you surprised by the results?
 - Have you ever cheated? If so, why?
 - What are some reasons people cheat?

The first article considers the anti-cheat battle as "an arms race where
security through obscurity is one of the fundamental tools". Do you think
there is any way to change that? If so, how? 

The Ring 0 of Fire article mentions an attack we've covered before, buffer
overflows. If these attacks are feasible, Vanguard's kernel level permissions
may pose a serious threat. Taking into account Saleem Rashid's comments,
including "it looks like it introduces a large attack surface for little
benefit". Do you think implementing kernel level anti-cheat is worth the risk?

Can you think of any ways to mitigate the need for anti-cheat in video games?
What are some potential non-technical solutions to cheating?

Consider the following scenario: You are developing the next big MMORPG. Given
that you want to earn money from this game, you plan to implement anti-cheat
measures to help ensure your game's success. Using the information in the
required readings (+ any additional knowledge you might have) attempt to
construct the hypothetical anti-cheat system for this game.  Where would you
start?  Are there any key features which must be included?
