Topic: "Discussion: Social Engineering" led by Jean-Philippe Pierre

Required material:

 -  [What is social engineering?](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-emerging-threats-what-is-social-engineering.html). An introduction to social engineering and some common examples of it.
 - [Social Engineering in Social Networking Sites: The Art of Impersonation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6930610). A study aiming to identify factors leading to successful social engineering attacks in social networks.
 - [RSA explains how attackers breached its systems](https://www.theregister.com/2011/04/04/rsa_hack_howdunnit/). An article outlining a real-life example of a social engineering attack.
 - [The Real Face of KOOBFACE: The Largest Web 2.0 Botnet Explained](https://www.trendmicro.co.uk/media/misc/the-real-face-of-koobface-research-paper-en.pdf). A paper explaining a botnet that propagated through phishing messages in social network sites.
 - [A multi-level defense against social engineering](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/engineering/multi-level-defense-social-engineering-920). A paper that details the methods that social engineering attackers use to obtain information and proposes a defense against social engineering.

Optional material:

 - [Thief woos bank staff with chocolates - then steals diamonds worth 14m](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/thief-woos-bank-staff-chocolates-then-steals-diamonds-worth-163-14m-5332414.html). In computer security, social engineering is often associated with uses of technology such as hacking or phishing. But in this example, someone uses social engineering to gain unauthorized access without using technological means.
 - [Towards Automating Social Engineering Using Social Networking Sites](https://publications.sba-research.org/publications/2009%20-%20Huber%20-%20Towards%20Automating%20Social%20Engineering%20Using%20Social%20Networking%20Sites.pdf). A paper proposing a way to use social media to carry out an automated social engineering attack.

### Discussion Questions

How many of us has seen or even been a victim of:
 - Email phishing
 - A friend’s hacked account sending you a message to open a link (which will probably break into your account if you open it)
 - Voice phishing (phone scams, for example)

Why do you think phishing is so common?

How would you define social engineering?

Often times, social engineering attackers use their victims’ trust to gain information. How can we know when and when not to trust communication we’ve received?
 - What would be different if we thought the communication came from a superior in our workplace? 
 - How could we ensure that the communication came from them?

There have been instances of 'social botnets', botnets consisting of compromised social media accounts that can propagate through social engineering tactics.
 - How feasible is it to determine whether we've received a message from a bot?
 - If a botnet could break into a friend's account, can we trust messages from anybody?
 - When should we be skeptical of a message we've received?
 - How skeptical should we be? Would it make sense to be suspicious of every communication we receive?

How can a social engineering attacker use social media to their advantage? How can social media assist in a social engineering attack?

What if a social engineering attacker impersonates someone you know or would be influenced by (for example, a family member, friend, celebrity, or higher-ranked coworker)?
 - How would we detect an impersonation attempt?
 - How practical would it be to do this for every communication we recieve?

Sometimes, attackers will use pressure to get a victim to act rashly and give over information without thinking first. What ways can we prevent attackers from gaining information by applying pressure?

Which is more critical to a successful social engineering attack: the social intelligence of the attacker, or the willingness of the victim to provide information?

How necessary is technology for a social engineering attack? 
 - Do you think social engineering depends more on technology or social interaction? Why?

What do you think an attacker would need to successfully carry out a social engineering attack?

How do you think we should defend against social engineering attacks?

Is there a trade-off between defenses against social engineering and convenience of obtaining information in good faith?
