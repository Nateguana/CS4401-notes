Python3 has some quirks that can make binary exploitation more difficult.

#### Issue: ``print()` isn't printing out the correct characters

If print is printing out characters with `\x`, this is a problem with the way
the python3 print function works.

```
>>> a = "\xaa\xbb\x90\xff"
>>> a
'ÂªÂ»\x90Ã¿'
```

```
>  python -c "print('\xaa\xbb\x90\xff')"|xxd
00000000: c2aa c2bb c290 c3bf 0a                   .........
```

```
> python2.7 -c "print('\xaa\xbb\x90\xff')"|xxd
00000000: aabb 90ff 0a
```

By default, print tries to print the characters as UTF-8, but some characters
like `\x90` do not have valid UTF-8 characters. There's a few ways to work
around this. 
  - Using `sys.stdout.buffer.write()` (you have to import `sys` first!).
    Instead of a string, this function takes a bytes-like object.
  - Specify the encoding as "latin-1" (ISO 8859-1).  


```
>>> import sys b = b'\xaa\xbb\x90\xff' sys.stdout.buffer.write(b)
    4 
``` 

```
> python -c "import sys;sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'\xaa\xbb\x90\xff')" | xxd
00000000: aabb 90ff 
```

#### IssueL  My pwntools code works in python2 but not python3

Many of the pwntools functions return bytes-like objects in python3. They work
closer to an array of bytes rather than a string. The main differences is that
you cannot concatenate bytes and strings. (Note: In python2, `bytes` and `str`
are aliases for the same type. In python3, they are separate!)

```
>>> from pwn import *
>>> "A"*10 + p64(0xdeadbeef)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "bytes") to str
>>> b"A"*10 + p64(0xdeadbeef)
b'AAAAAAAAAA\xef\xbe\xad\xde\x00\x00\x00\x00'
```

#### Issue: All `\x00` bytes are removed from my string

The codecs library seems to remove these bytes. Try manipulating your string
without the codecs library.  This can also happen when using bash command
substitution (backtick notation) sometimes (specifically when using command
substitution in radare2)
