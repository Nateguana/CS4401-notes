Topic: "Discussion: An Identity Crisis"  
  
  
Required material:  
  
  - ["Identity 2.0"][jt_identity20]. This talk discusses the notion of digital identity and proposes that a new version of identity, dubbed ‘Identity 2.0’, is needed to protect user privacy. This one is fun to listen to at 2x speed.
  - ["Biometrics for Homeland Security"][jt_biometrics_dhs]. This resource details use cases for biometric data in security-related U.S. departments, such as the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. If you scroll down the page, you will find tabs that contain more information for each department. 
  - ["Biometrics are coming, along with serious security concerns"][jt_biometrics_security].  
    This article from WIRED provides an overview of progress in biometric technology and its associated concerns with security and privacy. The article also provides perspective on using biometric authentication in commercial environments.
  - [The Quest to Replace Passwords: A Framework for Comparative Evaluation of Web Authentication Schemes"][jt_replace_passwords]. This 2012 Oakland paper proposes a framework to evaluate various authentication schemes that could replace passwords. Pay careful attention to Section II, which provides brief descriptions of each benefit that an ideal authentication scheme would provide, as well as Table I on page 563 that presents the evaluation results for each scheme.
  - ["Make-up techniques a potential weapon against unwanted facial recognition surveillance"][jt_facial_recognition]. This article from ABC Australia explains how using make-up to appear older can help you avoid facial recognition systems. Other methods are also mentioned, such as putting a silicone mask over your face.
    
Optional material:  
  - ["Facial Recognition Software Prompts Privacy, Racism Concerns in Cities and States"][jt_facial_rec_bias]. This article from PEW examines the challenges of using facial recognition systems in law enforcement, given that these systems have been shown to misidentify people of color more often than their white counterparts.
  - ["Hacking an iPhone fingerprint sensor using Play-Doh"][jt_playdoh]. This short video shows how a carefully crafted piece of Play-Doh can be used to unlock an iPhone.

### Discussion Questions  
  

Consider some parts of your physical identity and some parts of your digital identity. Are there any parts that overlap? Are there any parts that will always be the same?

Are there any parts of your physical and digital identity that should be off-limits to outside parties? In other words, is there any information about you that others should not use to identify or authenticate you?

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security details use cases for biometrics in law enforcement. What are some advantages and disadvantages to using biometric data for law and order? Is it clear which side prevails?

Biometric authentication has the potential to simplify commercial transactions. The WIRED article’s first example is for buying a pair of jeans using your ear. Should biometrics be limited to law enforcement, or should they also be accepted in commercial environments?

The 2012 IEEE paper claims that no authentication scheme maintains every benefit that legacy passwords provide. Do you think passwords will eventually be phased out in favor of biometric authentication schemes? If not, why will passwords still be relevant?

People have gone to great lengths to avoid facial recognition surveillance. The ABC article discusses make-up as a way to make someone look older and bypass facial recognition. Should these bypass mechanisms be allowed?

Biometric authentication schemes are not perfectly robust. Researchers have spoofed palm vein images to trick an authentication system 65% of the time. Another researcher showed how to use PlayDoh to unlock an Apple phone via TouchID. Should we take an ‘all-or-nothing’ approach to using biometric data for authentication, or are lapses in functionality and security acceptable?
