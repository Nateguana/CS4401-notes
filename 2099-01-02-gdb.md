Below is a smattering of gdb hints, tips, and tricks. Some might even be useful
during this course.  If you'd like to contribute to this cheatsheet, let me
know!  I recommend that students use the
[pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) plug-in as it makes GDB a little
nicer to work with. Pwndbg comes preconfigured on the EpicTreasure docker
image. 

**Arguments:**
 - Use `gdb -ex COMMAND` to start GDB and execute the given `COMMAND.` For
   example, `gdb -ex r` will load the binary in gdb and then execute the run
command.
 - Use `gdb --pid <pid>` to attach to a running process



**Basics:**
 - Use "-g" when compiling with GCC to enable debug symbols, providing more
   information to GDB. 
 - To switch to Intel syntax: `set disassembly-flavor intel`
 - Use `set {int}0x8049700=0xdeadbeef` to write the value 0xdeadbeef to address 0x8049700.
 - Remember you can use `int3` in your shellcode (op code `0xcc`) to cause a breakpoint.
 - Execute shell commands, e.g., `shell clear` will clear the screen.
 - Use the `dir` command to specify the local directory containing the source
   files.


**Running the binary:**
 - `run` and `r`  will run the current program.
 - `kill` will kill the current program.
 - Reload the binary: `file foo`, useful if you pop a shell with `execv` from inside
of gdb.
 - Run the current program with input from a file: `r < input.in`
 - Run the current program with command line args: `r foo bar`
 - Or run with arbitrary arguments: `r < <(python exploit.py)`

**Working with breakpoints:**
 - Setting by function symbol: `break *main` or `b *main`.
 - Setting by source code function: `break main`
 - By offset in function: `b *main+10`
 - By address: `break *0x400D02`
 - By line number in file: `break foo.c:12`
 - List current break points: `info break`
 - `delete <num>` deletes a breakpoint by number
 - `clear` delete all breakpoints
 - `enable <num>` enables a breakpoint by number
 - `disable <num>` disables a breakpoint by number 

**Stepping:**
 - `si` will step instruction by instruction going into function calls whereas
 - `ni` will step over function calls.
 - `step` will execute until the next source line, going into function calls.
 - `next` will execute until the next source line, not going into functions.
 - `finish` will execute until the current funciton returns
 - `continue` will continue normal execution.
 - Be careful though, `si` and `ni` seem to skip over `int3` instructions.
 - `f 4` will jump to the fourth stack frame. This is useful when an error
   occurs within a library function and you'd like to see what arguments were
passed from the calling function(s). 

**Working with the heap:**
 - `heap chunks` (gef only) will give a list of the current heap chunks.
 - `heap bins` (gef only) will summarize the current state of all heap bins.

**Working with registers:**
 - Getting values: `info registers` or `i r`
 - Setting values: `set $eax=0`

**Getting information:**
 - `info functions`
 - `disassemble main` or `disass main` to disassemble a function.
 - This command will disassemble the function that contains the instruction at
   address 0x08... `disassemble 0x08...`
 - (gef only) `aslr` will tell you if aslr is enabled. Note that the output may be
   different before running the binary. You can disable ASLR with `aslr off`.
 - (gef only) Use `vmmap` to view memory regions and permissions. 
 - View the mapped address space: `info proc mappings`
 - Print out the string representation of the bytes at a given address: `x/s 0x4005d0` 
 - Print out a word of memory relative to the stack pointer: `x/wx $esp+0x5c` 
 - `x foo` will give you the location of function `foo`.
 - `p system` will give you the address of the libc function `system`.
 - Use `backtrace` to find out where you where in a program when it crashed, e.g.,
after a segmentation fault. Caveat, if your bug smashes the stack then the
backtrace won't be able to make much sense of where you are.
 - Use `backtrace full` to show the call stack and print the value of local
   variables. 
 - To find what address caused a segmentation fault: `p $_siginfo._sifields._sigfault.si_addr`. If it shows `(void *) 0x0` (or a small number), then you have a NULL pointer dereference.
 - Use `find 0x7ffffffde000, 0x7ffffffff000-1, 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'` to search
   for the string that starts with the pattern `aaaa`---assuming the stack
range given by `vmmap` is 0x7ffffffde000 to 0x7ffffffff000. Note that the
subtraction of 1 from the end address is necessary to avoid the error "Unable
to access 7169 bytes of target memory at 0x7fffffffd400, halting search."

**Pagination:**
 - `set pagination on`
 - `set pagination off`
 - `show pagination`



#### Creating Hooks 

Create a hook to print some information on every break point:

```
define hook-stop
info registers
x/24wx $esp
x/2i $eip
end
```
This hook will print all of the register values, the stack, and the next two
instructions.


#### Viewing struct values nicely:

```
set $foo = (struct bar *) 0x804a008

#get the address
print $foo

#get a value of the struct's members
print *$foo

#get the value of an attribute
print $foo->name

#examine the memory at the address stored in the attribute
x $foo->name
```
